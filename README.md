## Project Description

This project utilizes the Three.js library to create an interactive 3D scene showcasing a model airplane. The main objectives of the project were to explore the basic features of Three.js, including loading 3D models, scene manipulation, camera control, and lighting.

## Objectives

1. **Explore Three.js:** The main goal was to become familiar with the Three.js library, a powerful tool for 3D rendering in web browsers.

2. **Loading 3D Models:** Using Three.js's OBJLoader, the project loads a 3D model of an airplane and renders it in the scene.

3. **Camera Control:** Camera controls were implemented to allow user interaction with the 3D scene. The controls enable users to move the camera around the scene and observe the airplane model from different angles.

4. **Lighting:** Lighting was added to the scene to highlight the details of the 3D model and create a more realistic atmosphere.

## Learnings

During the development of this project, the following learnings were acquired:

1. **Fundamentals of 3D Rendering:** Understanding the basic concepts of 3D rendering, including scene, camera, geometry, and materials.

2. **Using Three.js:** Learning how to start a project with Three.js, including setting up the scene, loading 3D models, and manipulating the camera.

3. **Interactive Camera Control:** Implementing interactive camera controls to allow users to explore the 3D scene.

4. **3D Model Manipulation:** Experimentation with loading, positioning, and rotating 3D models in the scene.

## Resources Used

- **Three.js:** JavaScript library for 3D rendering in the browser.
- **OBJLoader:** Loader for 3D models in OBJ format.
- **OrbitControls:** Interactive camera controls for navigation in the 3D scene.

This project served as a practical introduction to development with Three.js, providing a solid foundation for future projects involving interactive 3D graphics on the web. üöÄ
